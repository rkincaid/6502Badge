This repository is a collection of existing programs I've collected and modified to
to run on the 6502 Badge Single Board Computer.
You can relive 70's era computing on a $30 computer you build yourself.
The "Badge" is an interesting, extremely mininmal but capable
6502 computer. Kits and documentation are found here:

While small and consisting of just a few parts, the "Badge" is a fully functional
6502 computer with up to 32K of RAM, a somewhat unique LED display and most importantly 
a serial interface for terminal communications. So it is functionally very
comparable to early DIY hobby/educational computers floating around 
in the 70's. After building my own, I was intrigued with trying to see how much I
could get it to do. It's really kind of in the sprit of those early days
when folks were hacking their homebuilt rigs to do all kinds of unusal things.
So I started tracking down iconic programs from
that era and a few newer ones. Fortunately, a lot of source code in BASIC and 6502
assembly are now archived somewhere on the internet. So the
repository here is the result of my fun going down a time tunnel
and digging up these old and new gems.
