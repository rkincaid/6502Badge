This repo is under construction and the programs contained within are
in the process of conversion, testing and debugging. If this is of interest,
please check back in a few weeks to see if things are more stable and
more fully documented. In the meantime... Here's a teaser showing
classic KIM-1 era Microchess running on my 6502 Badge (details to
follow soon):

This repository is a collection of existing programs I've hacked to
to run on the 6502 Badge Single Board Computer.
You can relive 70's era computing on a $30 computer you build yourself.
The "Badge" is an interesting, extremely mininmal but capable
6502 computer. Kits and documentation are found here:

While small and consisting of just a few parts, the "Badge" is a fully functional
6502 computer with up to 32K of RAM, a somewhat unit LED display and most importantly 
a serial interface for terminal commuications. So it is very
comparable functionally to early hobby/educational computers floating around 
in the 70's. After building my own, I was intrigued with trying to see how much I
could get it to do. It's really kind of in the sprit of those early days
when folks were hacking their homebuilt rigs to do all kinds of unusal things.
So I started tracking down iconic programs from
that era. Fortunately, a lot of source code in BASIC and 6502
assembly are now archived somewhere on the internet. So the
repository here is the result of my fun going down a time tunnel
and digging up these old gems. If you were around back then (like I
was) and you have a "Badge" computer, you might enjoy the trip down
memory lane of getting these old friends running again.
